# Density Matrix Reconstruction (Single Qubit)

This project implements a Transformer-based neural network to reconstruct the quantum state (density matrix) of a single qubit from measurement data (classical shadows), while strictly enforcing physical constraints.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Source code for data generation, model, and training.
- `outputs/`: Saved models and training logs.
- `docs/`: Documentation for the model and replication steps.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Qutip (optional, for verification)
