## Disclosure
This project was developed with the assistance of Google DeepMind's AI assistant.

## Prompt Links
- **Architectural Decisions**: The choice of Transformer architecture for Track 1 was suggested by the AI based on the sequence nature of measurement data.
- **Code Generation**: Core boilerplate for PyTorch models and training loops were generated by AI and verified by the user.
- **Full Chat Log**: [PASTE LINK HERE]


## Verification
- All mathematical constraints (Cholesky decomposition) were manually verified against standard quantum mechanics definitions.
- The fidelity metrics are cross-referenced with standard formulas.
